## Features

- **Create Polls:** Admin users can easily create questions and add multiple answer choices.
- **Vote:**  Users can view available polls and vote for their preferred choices.
- **Results:** Real-time results are displayed after voting, showing the distribution of votes.
- **Admin Dashboard:**  A robust admin interface allows for managing questions, choices, and viewing results.
- **Correct Answers:** Admin users can specify correct answers for each question, and users see if they voted correctly on the results page.
- **Homepage and Navigation:** Clear navigation between the homepage (list of polls), poll details, and results.
- **Basic Styling:**  Includes basic CSS styles for a clean and visually appealing presentation.

## Technologies Used

- **Django:** Web framework for rapid development.
- **Python:** The programming language used for the backend logic.
- **HTML/CSS:**  For structuring and styling the user interface.
- **JavaScript (Optional):** Used for adding interactivity (e.g., Chart.js in your `results.html`).

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone the repository using the Code button in the repository's main GitHub page.

2. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
   .\venv\Scripts\activate    # Windows
   ```

4. **Run Migrations:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. **Create Admin User:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

6. **Start the Server:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
   
**Important**: Remember to change the Django production secret key and set `DEBUG` to `True` in `PollApplication/settings.py` order to run the server:
```python
SECRET_KEY = 'your_secret_key'

DEBUG = True
```

Also, as you develop the app, every time you make changes to the data in the back end, be sure that you migrate them to the SQLite database using the following commands:
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

Then start the server again using `python manage.py runserver` and you'll be all set!

## Usage

1. **Access the Admin Interface:** Go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/` and log in with your superuser credentials.
2. **Create Polls:**
    - Click "Polls" or "Questions" in the admin interface.
    - Click "Add Question" and fill out the question text and publication date.
    - Click "Save and continue editing" to add answer choices.
    - Mark the correct answer using the checkbox.
3. **View Polls:** Visit the homepage (`http://127.0.0.1:8000/polls/`) to see the list of available polls.
4. **Vote:** Click on a poll to view details and select your answer.
5. **View Results:** After voting, you'll be redirected to the results page, where you can see the vote distribution and whether you answered correctly.

## Customization

- **Templates:** Modify the HTML templates (`index.html`, `detail.html`, `results.html`) to customize the look and feel of the poll pages.
- **Styling:** Add more CSS rules to `style.css` or create new stylesheets for further customization.
- **Functionality:** Extend the models or views to add more features like user authentication, poll comments, or social media sharing.

## REST API Usage

This app also includes a REST API built with Django REST Framework (DRF). Here are the available endpoints:

| Endpoint               |        Methods         | Description                                 | Authentication Required |
|:-----------------------|:----------------------:|:--------------------------------------------|:-----------------------:|
| `/api/questions/`      | GET, POST, PUT, DELETE | List/create/update/delete questions.        |            ✅            |
| `/api/questions/<id>/` |    GET, PUT, DELETE    | Retrieve/update/delete a specific question. |            ✅            |
| `/api/choices/`        | GET, POST, PUT, DELETE | List/create/update/delete choices.          |            ✅            |
| `/api/choices/<id>/`   |    GET, PUT, DELETE    | Retrieve/update/delete a specific choice.   |            ✅            |

**Example Usage (with curl):**

```bash
# Get all questions
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/questions/

# Get a specific question
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/questions/1/
```

For example, if you run `curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/questions/`, you will get this output: 

```json
[{"id":3,"question_text":"huhu","pub_date":"2024-06-10T07:21:01Z"},{"id":4,"question_text":"hehehehe","pub_date":"2024-06-11T15:01:59Z"},{"id":5,"question_text":"What is the capital of France?","pub_date":"2024-06-11T15:11:04Z"}]
```

You can also directly visit the API endpoints in your browser:

</p>

**Authentication:**
To use POST, PUT, or DELETE methods, you'll need a valid token, typically obtained after user login. Include this token in the Authorization header:
  
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Token <your_token>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"question_text": "Is this a new question?", "pub_date": "2023-12-12T12:00:00Z"}' http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/questions/
```
